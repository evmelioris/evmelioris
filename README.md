### Howdy, Welcome to my profile!

Founder of Tech Launch Consulting


I am currently a software engineer at Deloitte, but in my free time I am an aspiring leader in the tech start up space. My free time is spent with collaborating developers who are passionate about tech start ups. If you are interested in networking with talented developers you've come to the right place!

I'm currently working with Javascript, React, Python, and AWS. Most of my current personal projects include web development with React frameworks.
